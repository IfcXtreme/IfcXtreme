# Welcome to IfcXtreme
IfcXtreme is the next generation of IfcDoc

[IfcDoc](https://technical.buildingsmart.org/resources/ifcdoc/) from [buildingSMART International](https://www.buildingsmart.org/) plays a vital role in the OpenBIM environment, but its complexity caused fewer Building Information Modeling/Management - BIM experts in the industry to know and use it.
For this reason, we decided to build a transparent and easy to use software which will help OpenBIM, especially in Automation and Control aspects.

So to make it easier for us (and avoid any legal issues) we prefer if patches are released as public domain.
