## Contributing
We encourage you to contribute to IfcXtreme! If you would like to contribute to IfcXtreme, you should subscribe to the developers mailing list ([IfcXtreme-dev](http://eepurl.com/gvsWSP)), where the developers of IfcXtreme discuss the development.

You can send pull requests via GitHub. Patches should:

1.  Follow the style of the existing code.
2.  One commit should do exactly one thing.
3.  Commit messages should start with a summary line below 80 characters followed by a blank line, and then the reasoning/analysis for why the change was made (if appropriate).
4.  Commits that fix a bug in a previous commit (which has already been merged) should start with `fixup!` and then the summary line of the commit it fixes.
5.  Rebase your branch against the upstream’s master. We don’t want to pull redundant merge commits.
6.  **Be clear about what license applies to your patch:** The files within this repository are under the MIT and GPL3 (or later) but, as the original creators, we are still allowed to create non-free derivatives. However, if patches are given to us under GPL then those cannot make it into any non-free derivatives we may later wish to create. So to make it easier for us (and avoid any legal issues) we prefer if patches are released as public domain.
